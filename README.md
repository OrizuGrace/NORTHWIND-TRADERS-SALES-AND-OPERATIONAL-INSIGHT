 Shipping & Delivery
â€¢	Top Metrics Overview
â€¢	Total Freight Cost: $64.94K
â€¢	Average Delivery Time: 8 days
â€¢	Total Late Shipments: 37
â€¢	On-Time Delivery Rate: 98.02%
â€¢	 Insight:
You're operating at a very high delivery performance rate with only 1.98% of shipments late. This is exceptional in logisticsâ€”shows strong operational efficiency.
Delivery time is relatively consistent across countries, but Ireland stands out as being slower by 2 days. This could be due to distance, customs, or internal processing delays. Worth investigating further.
United Package generates the highest revenue, suggesting it handles either high-volume or high-value shipments. It might be your primary logistics partnerâ€”evaluate their cost-benefit performance closely.
High order density in:
o	USA
o	Brazil
o	Germany
o	France
o	Australia
These countries are your key markets for order volume. Strategically, consider setting up fulfillment centers or improving warehousing near these regions for even faster delivery.

 Recommendations
1.	Investigate Ireland's delivery delaysâ€”see if a new carrier or route can reduce the average.
2.	Audit United Package's delivery issues despite their high volume. Can performance improve further?
3.	Leverage Federal Shipping's efficiency more if cost-effective.
4.	Use volume data to optimize regional warehousing or fulfillment partnerships.
5.	Maintain the 98% on-time rateâ€”it's a massive trust factor for customer satisfaction and loyalty.
